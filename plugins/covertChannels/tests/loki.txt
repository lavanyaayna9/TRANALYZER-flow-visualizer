Trace capture procedure
-----------------------
1) Start both workstations
2) Start VMs on both workstations
3) Check that WM1 can ping VM2
4) Record traffic on Workstation1
    sudo tcpdump -s 0 -i eth0 -w loki.dmp
5) Start the loki server on VM2
    ./lokid
6) Connect to loki server from VM1
    ./loki -d 10.20.5.149
7) Enter a few command on the created shell

----------
Plugin successfully detects Loki with very simple classifier
  -> asymmetric ICMP flow with several packets
Hans is supposed to tunnel data in a symmetric ICMP flow, so
the classifier will need to be adjusted to also detect it.
