# This is the default configuration for httpSniffer
#
# Apply the configuration as follows:
#     - t2conf httpSniffer --reset
#
# If you want to customize the default configuration, proceed as follows:
#     1. Create 'httpSniffer.config':
#           t2conf httpSniffer -g
#     2. Edit 'httpSniffer.config'
#     3. Apply 'httpSniffer.config':
#           t2conf httpSniffer -C httpSniffer.config
#
# [Format of the file]
#     - Empty lines and lines starting with '%' or '#'â€™ are ignored.
#     - One section starting with '# :name: pluginName" per file.
#     - If no section starting with '# :file: path/to/file.h" is specified,
#       it is assumed the file is src/pluginName.h (relative to plugin folder)
#         - If a configuration element applies to a different file, a file
#           section MUST be used
#         - Filenames are relative to plugin folder, i.e., httpSniffer,
#           e.g., src/httpSniffer.h
#     - A line is composed of the name of a macro (define) in the header file
#       followed by an equal sign and the value to set for the define:
#           NAME = value
#       where value can be anything, including yes (= 1) and no (= 0)
#     - Add a comment before each setting to describe the configuration option
#       and its valid values:
#           # Description of the option [yes / no]
#       or
#           # Description of the option [0 - 255]
#       or
#           # Description of the option:
#           #   0: description of value 0
#           #   1: description of value 1
#           #   2: description of value 2
