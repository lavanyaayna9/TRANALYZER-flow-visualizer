TRANALYZER FLOW VISUALIZER With IP & Domain Lookup

Project Description

Tranalyzer Flow Visualizer is a Streamlit-based interactive dashboard that provides visual analysis of network traffic flows generated by Tranalyzer2. Designed for security analysts, researchers, and enthusiasts, the app allows users to upload .pcap files, process them with Tranalyzer plugins, and explore the results through rich visualizations.

It also includes a built-in IP and domain intelligence lookup tool that fetches WHOIS, DNS, geolocation, and hosting data for deeper inspection of external traffic endpoints.

FEATURES:

1.Upload and analyze .pcap files using Tranalyzer2

2.Visual dashboards for protocols, top IPs, and geolocation

3.Domain & IP intelligence (WHOIS, DNS, ASN, geo info)

4.Clean responsive UI using Streamlit

INSTALLATION GUIDE

1. Clone the Repository
   
git clone https://github.com/lavanyaayna9/TRANALYZER-flow-visualizer.git

3. Setup Tranalyzer2 (one-time)

---Navigate to your Tranalyzer directory:

cd tranalyzer2-0.9.3

---Run setup:

./setup.sh

source ~/.bashrc

---Install system dependencies:

sudo apt-get install autoconf autoconf-archive automake libbsd-dev libpcap-dev libreadline-dev libtool make meson zlib1g-dev

---Set and confirm your T2 path:

export T2HOME="$PWD"

echo $T2HOME

---Build all plugins:

t2build -a

---If any plugin fails, build it individually:

t2build <plugin-name>

---Ensure the following plugins are built:

basicFlow

basicStats

protoStats

connStat

descriptiveStats

dnsDecode

geoip

nDPI

portClassifier

sslDecode

tcpFlags

tcpStates

pktSIATHisto

txtSink

List built plugins:

t2build -l

---Test your setup:

t2 -r sample_file.pcap

You should see an analysis output. If not, refer to: https://tranalyzer.com/tutorial/installation

3. Run the Flow Visualizer

Activate virtual env: source t2flow-env/bin/activate

Step 1: Find Tranalyzer Path

---From your project root, run:

find . -type f -name "tranalyzer"

---Copy the full path it returns — e.g.:

/home/youruser/tranalyzer2-0.9.3/tranalyzer2/build/tranalyzer

Step 2: Install Python dependencies

---Navigate to your project folder and install:

cd project

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Configure your Tranalyzer path

---Edit the path used in the upload script:

cd pages

nano 1_Upload_pcap.py

Replace the value of t2_path with your copied Tranalyzer path.

Save & exit:

Press Ctrl + O → Enter (to save)

Press Ctrl + X (to exit)

Step 4: Launch the App

---Go back to project directory and run:

cd ..

streamlit run Home.py
