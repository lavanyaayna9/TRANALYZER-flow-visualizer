# Mapping between Tranalyzer column names and other program names
#
# Note that if a column name is already defined as a function in tawk, you
# will get the following error:
#
#     gawk: cmd. line:1: error: function `name' called with space between name and `(',
#     or used as a variable or an array
#
# To fix that, either rename your column differently or use tawk -t option
# to have tawk suffix the column name with an underscore, e.g., proto -> proto_
#
# The following naming conventions is used:
#   _my_t2ColName = other_prog_col_name  # Column description
